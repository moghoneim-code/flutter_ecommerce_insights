## Design Decisions and Approaches

### Responsive Design

The application is designed to work seamlessly across mobile, tablet, and web platforms. Here's an explanation of the approach:

#### Dynamic Layouts Using `MediaQuery`

`MediaQuery` is used to detect the screen width and adapt the layout dynamically.

**Example:**

```dart
final screenWidth = MediaQuery.of(context).size.width;
if (screenWidth > 600) {
  // Web/Desktop layout / tablet
}  else {
  // Mobile layout
}
```

- ** You Will find the Order.dart model in the shared folder , as it is used in the different screens.
- ** Please Note :  the feature [graph] doesn't have a data layer as there is no data to be fetched from the server, because i passed the data as a list of objects in the screen itself.

This ensures the app looks good on various devices without the need for separate codebases.

#### Custom Widgets for Responsivity

Widgets like `ResponsiveCard` abstract the layout logic for wide and narrow screens.

**Example:**

```dart
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  final isWideScreen = MediaQuery.of(context).size.width > 600;
  return isWideScreen ? buildWideLayout(context) : buildNarrowLayout(context);
}
```

This approach allows flexibility while keeping the code clean and modular.

#### Scalable UI with Flexible Widgets

Widgets like `ListView.builder` and `Expanded` are used to handle dynamic content and prevent overflow issues.

---

### Why This Approach?

- **Maintainability:** Abstracting responsive logic into widgets like `ResponsiveCard` ensures the code is modular and easy to update.
- **Reusability:** Common responsive components can be reused across the application, reducing duplication.
- **Future-proofing:** By detecting screen sizes dynamically, the app can easily adapt to new devices or form factors.

---

### Using `Provider` for State Management

The `Provider` package is used for managing application state because:

- It is simple yet powerful for managing state at various levels of the widget tree.
- It keeps the UI reactive by notifying listeners whenever state changes.
- It integrates seamlessly with Flutterâ€™s widget lifecycle.
